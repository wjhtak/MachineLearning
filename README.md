# Machine Learning
A repository for my understanding of Machine Learning. I will update it as I keep on learning more about Machine Learning. It is specifically a repository for Machine Learning and I will make a new one for Deep Learning specifically.

# What is ML?
The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

# Machine Learning Algorithms

## **Supervised Learning**
Train with samples or labeled data.
* Regression: Problem dealing with numbers (Predict any number from (infinitely) many numbers) e.g, predict the price of the house.
* Classification: Problem dealing with classes (Only a small (finite) number of outputs or classes, also sometimes called as categories) e.g, find dogs or cats in an image, breast cancer classification problem.

## **Unsupervised Learning**
Algorithm has to find some structure or some pattern or something interesting in the unlabeled data. We don't supervise it.
* Clustering: Group similar data points together or divide the data into different groups or clusters e.g, Google News, Grouping Customers .
* Anomaly detection: Find something unusual in the data points e.g, fraud detection
* Dimensionality Reduction: Compress data set without losing as much as infomration as possible.

# Linear Regression Model
It is a type of supervised learning alogorithm. It means just fitting a straight line to your data. Linear function is just a fancy way of saying a line.
